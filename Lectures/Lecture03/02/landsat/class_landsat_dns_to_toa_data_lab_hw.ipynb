In comparison to Landsat 5, Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) images consist of nine spectral bands with a spatial resolution of 30 meters for Bands 1 to 7 and 9. The ultra-blue Band 1 is useful for coastal and aerosol studies and Band 9 is useful for cirrus cloud detection. The resolution for Band 8 (panchromatic) is 15 meters while the thermal IR bands 10 and 11 are useful in providing more accurate surface temperatures and are collected at 100 meters.\n","\n","Please refer to your readings for an overview of the continuity of multispectral data coverage provided by the follow up Landsat missions. Even though some of the Landsat-8 bands are slightly narrower in the spectral domain (i.e. SWIR-1) than the previous Landsat sensors, they provide at least one band corresponding to each of the Landsat 5 and 7 bands. Thanks to this feature of Landsat, we can use data from subsequent Landsat missions in a time series analysis. \n","\n","Key specifications of Landsat 8 can be found [here](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eros/science/usgs-eros-archive-landsat-archives-landsat-8-oli-operational-land-imager-and?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects).\n","\n","For more information on the Landsat bands and spectral characteristics of various land surfaces have a look at this [link](https://landsat.usgs.gov/spectral-characteristics-viewer).\n","\n","Feel free to import and have a look at the image bands in QGIS (just drag and drop the LC08_L1TP_014035_20160727_20170222_01_T1.tar.gz into QGIS and select the bands you want to visualize).

Converting Digital Numbers (DNs) to Top of Atmosphere (TOA) Reflectance\n","Sensors on board the Landsat satellite record at sensor radiance expressed in watt per steradian per square meter.\n","Because storing this in radiance units is difficult, sensors translate measured radiance into digital numbers (DNs). DNs express the amount of radiance in relation to sensor-specific calibration coefficients, which determine the minimum and maximum amount of radiance that can be measured. \n","\n","For example, the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM)/Landsat 5 as well as the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+)/Landsat 7 sensors acquire data and store this information as 8-bit digital number (DN) with a range between 0 and 255. Landsat 8 has a 12 bit radiometric resolution, which is artificially quantized to 16 bit. The 16 bit resolution can represent much more different grey shades compared to L5 and L7, namely 2^16 or 65,536 values.\n","\n","DNs are not physically meaningful and are dependent on the sensor calibration, with identical measurements yielding different DNs across sensors. Instead of DNs, we are interested in reflectance, which represents the fraction of reflected radiance relative to the total incoming energy from the sun in the case of Landsat. \n","\n","In order to be able to work with the data we need to convert these DNs to Top of Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance if we are to apply the same algorithm on multiple images across space or over time. This is a two-step process first converting the DNs to radiance values using the bias and gain values specific to the individual scene we are working with, and second converting the radiance data to TOA reflectance. \n","Many applications also require the data corrected for the influence of atmosphere (atmospherically corrected), thus going one step further from TOA to surface reflectance (SR) also known as bottom-of-atmosphere reflectance (BOA).\n","USGS is providing [SR data on demand](https://www.usgs.gov/land-resources/nli/landsat/landsat-surface-reflectance?qt-science_support_page_related_con=0#qt-science_support_page_related_con), which you can access by following the steps under \"Access Data\" [here](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eros/science/usgs-eros-archive-landsat-archives-landsat-8-olitirs-level-2-data-products?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"4qku-Kzx8YVn"},"source":["The sensor calibration (DN to radiance) and conversion to top-of-atmosphere reflectance (radiance to TOA) involve a linear scaling of the DN values which uses two band-specific rescaling factors (one multiplicative, one additive).  \n","\n","[PLESE READ THIS INFO BEFORE PROCEEDING!]\n","\n","Formulas are explained (also copied below) in the USGS guide for conversion to [TOA Reflectance](https://www.usgs.gov/land-resources/nli/landsat/using-usgs-landsat-level-1-data-product).\n","\n","With the Landsat 8 Collection 1 data (this is not the case for all sensors!), we can use a single set of coefficients to convert DNs directly to TOA reflectance:\n","\n","ρλ′=Mρ∗Qcal+Aρ\n","\n","where\n","\n","ρλ′ = TOA planetary reflectance, without correction for solar angle.\n","\n","Mρ = Band-specific multiplicative rescaling factor from the metadata.\n","\n","Qcal = Quantized and calibrated standard product pixel values (DN).\n","\n","Aρ = Band-specific additive rescaling factor from the metadata.\n","\n","In a next step, we can correct for solar angle during image acquisition.\n","\n","ρλ=ρλ′/cos(θSZ)=ρλ′/sin(θSE)\n","\n","where\n","\n","ρλ = TOA planetary reflectance corrected for solar angle.\n","\n","θSZ = Local solar zenith angle, whereas θSZ=90°−θSE.\n","\n","θSE = Local sun elevation angle\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":9,"metadata":{"id":"Z5KWtYXO8YVn","tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["# You should be able to use the GIS712 conda env that we created last week.\n","import os\n","import rasterio     \n","import numpy as np\n","from math import radians, sin"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":10,"metadata":{"id":"6MlKkdUf8YVo","outputId":"8564e8be-8e2f-40c8-e4af-75a238852ba2"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["'c:\\\\Users\\\\cblim\\\\Documents\\\\NCSU\\\\Courses\\\\GIS712\\\\code\\\\Lectures\\\\Lecture03\\\\02\\\\landsat'"]},"execution_count":10,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["# Navigate to the location of your landsat folder, use the command below to make sure you are there\n","os.getcwd() # gets the current working dir\n","# os.listdir() # lists files \n","# if you're not in the right location, please navigate to your landsat folder using os.chdir(path)\n","# so os.chdir(path), my path is '/Users/mtulbure/Downloads/GIS712_2024/landsat'"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":11,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["c:\\Users\\cblim\\Documents\\NCSU\\Courses\\GIS712\\code\\Lectures\\Lecture03\\02\\landsat\\data\\LC08_L1TP_014035_20160727_20170222_01_T1\n"]}],"source":["#First unzip the tar.gz file, get the path of the unzipped folder\n","L8_file_path = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'data', 'LC08_L1TP_014035_20160727_20170222_01_T1')\n","print(L8_file_path)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":12,"metadata":{"id":"4rlXYK4u8YVp","outputId":"d5c7ce35-5540-456f-dbd1-552d83c9af81"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["c:\\Users\\cblim\\Documents\\NCSU\\Courses\\GIS712\\code\\Lectures\\Lecture03\\02\\landsat\\data\\LC08_L1TP_014035_20160727_20170222_01_T1\\LC08_L1TP_014035_20160727_20170222_01_T1_MTL.txt\n"]}],"source":["# get the path of the metadata file:\n","meta_file_path = os.path.join(L8_file_path, \"LC08_L1TP_014035_20160727_20170222_01_T1_MTL.txt\")\n","print(meta_file_path)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":13,"metadata":{"id":"D-B6wrzu8YVq","tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["# Extract numeric values for REFLECTANCE_MULT_BAND_x, REFLECTANCE_ADD_BAND_x [where x is the band number], \n","# and SUN_ELEVATION.
